This as a book inventory application made with the help of Python and Mysql.
Book inventory system is an application through which a user will be able to manage the book data and do certain kind of operations 
like 

1.Adding a book
2.Updating the details of the book
3.Deleting or removing the books
4.View the details of all the books available
5.Search the information of any book just by using UNIQUE id of the book and can get the deatils like author, publication, no of pages and date of publish.

These all operations will be done in the database Book which I have created in my system.

I have used used tkinter library for the GUI part as I am familiar with it.

I have not created any login system as it was mentioned that any user can use this application so I have assumed that it is public to use and anyone cam use it.

Now, to run this application you can just use Visual studio code or python and can easily run it as I have not used any kind of framework so there is no such requirement of installing
any different kind of depencies or softwares.

It was not mentioned in the application that which framework to use which database to connect with, So I have assumed that we have to keep it simple and sober.
